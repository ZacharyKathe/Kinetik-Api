# Kinetic - "Staying in motion, together."
## [Kinetik App](http://kinetikapp.herokuapp.com/)


## Kinetik is a social goal-tracking application that helps each user strive towards their specific goal, communally.

We looked at the pool of goal-tracking apps out there, and found that there were not any that had their focus on a small group goal-achieving effort. We took all of the great things about a personal goal-tracking experience and layered the social element on top of it, believing that communal encouragement is a crucial part of staying motivated.

## Usage

This app is designed to be minimal in its design and learning curve. A new user simple beings their experience by creating a new goal or goals, then updating them as they make progress. The app keeps track of the progress, and displays the necessary information back to the user. They also have the option to make a new group, and invite anyonr via email to join that group, sharing the goals they choose for those group members to see and interact with.
